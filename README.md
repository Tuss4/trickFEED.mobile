trickFEED for FFOS

5/7/2013

- Pretty much the same code, used in trickFEED, just barely tweaked for FFOS!

Installation
------------
- Prerequisite: You must have the Firefox OS Simulator installed on your version of Firefox. Directions here: 
    [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator#Installing_the_Simulator_add-on](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator#Installing_the_Simulator_add-on)

- Open Firefox then go to "Tools>Web Developer>Firefox OS Simulator,"
- Once on the dashboard click "Add Directory" to navigate to the location of trickFEED's webapp.manifest
- Voila! Enjoy!

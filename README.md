trickFEED for FFOS

5/7/2013

- Pretty much the same code, used in trickFEED, just barely tweaked for FFOS!

How To Install:
- Prerequisite: You must have the Firefox OS Simulator installed on your version of Firefox.

- Open Firefox then go to "Tools>Web Developer>Firefox OS Simulator,"
- Once on the dashboard click "Add Directory" to navigate to the location of trickFEED's webapp.manifest
- Voila! Enjoy!
